"Tanglu is not an 'offical' Debian project, although it was started together "

"will sync the permissions of all Debian developers, so they can maintain "
"their packages in Tanglu during a Debian freeze if they want to do that, so "
"Tanglu and it's users get the latest upstream software, while Debian can "
"start the new release cycle with already tested packages from Tanglu. We "
"believe that this will increase the package quality and result in a less "
"rough start of Debian development after a freeze. However, Tanglu is not a "
"Debian experimental distribution or playground for untested software. "
"Everything in Tanglu should be usable for it's users and be released upstream "
"software. We are in contact with Debian and try to keep the delta between "
"Tanglu and Debian as low as possible, so we do not introduce "
